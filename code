/*You need to store sales for seven different types of salsa: mild, medium, hot, sweet, fruit, verde, and zesty.
You will need two parallel 7 element arrays.An array of strings to hold the salsa names and an array of integers
holding the number of jars sold during the past month for each type of salsa..
Create a string array and initialize it with the salsa types.The program should prompt the user to enter
the number of jars sold for each type.Use input validation with a loop to ensure that negative values are not input.
Once the data is input, the program should display a report that shows sales for each salsa type, total
sales(total number of jars sold) and the names of the highestand lowest selling products.*/
